# Getting Started
!!!warning
Do not actually type out `<` `>` `[` `]`, etc. These are placeholders for the actual arguments, and all commands are slash commands.
!!!

!!!info
The user permissions required to execute certain commands will be listed under the command name.
Example:

/ban

`Ban Members`

Each Bot has its own page, so you won't miss anything!

## Basic Understanding

All bots have the following cogs:

`Info` - Information about the bot and its developers. 

`Misc` - Miscellaneous commands.

## Future Reference
Not all commands are the same in those cogs, but the commands that are in all bots will be found on the [Common Commands](/guides/common-commands.md) page.
